The new list is 

Function Description

Complete the mergeLists function in the editor below.

mergeLists has the following parameters:

SinglyLinkedListNode pointer headA: a reference to the head of a list
SinglyLinkedListNode pointer headB: a reference to the head of a list
Returns

SinglyLinkedListNode pointer: a reference to the head of the merged list
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of test cases.

The format for each test case is as follows:

The first line contains an integer , the length of the first linked list.
The next  lines contain an integer each, the elements of the linked list.
The next line contains an integer , the length of the second linked list.
The next  lines contain an integer each, the elements of the second linked list.

Constraints

, where  is the  element of the list.
