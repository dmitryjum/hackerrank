Jesse loves cookies and wants the sweetness of some cookies to be greater than value . To do this, two cookies with the least sweetness are repeatedly mixed. This creates a special combined cookie with:

sweetness  Least sweet cookie   2nd least sweet cookie).

This occurs until all the cookies have a sweetness .

Given the sweetness of a number of cookies, determine the minimum number of operations required. If it is not possible, return .

Example


The smallest values are .
Remove them then return  to the array. Now .
Remove  and return  to the array. Now .
Remove , return  and .
Finally, remove  and return  to . Now .
All values are  so the process stops after  iterations. Return .

Function Description
Complete the cookies function in the editor below.

cookies has the following parameters:

int k: the threshold value
int A[n]: an array of sweetness values
Returns

int: the number of iterations required or 
Input Format

The first line has two space-separated integers,  and , the size of  and the minimum required sweetness respectively.

The next line contains  space-separated integers, .

Explanation

Combine the first two cookies to create a cookie with sweetness  = 
After this operation, the cookies are .
Then, combine the cookies with sweetness  and sweetness , to create a cookie with resulting sweetness  = 
Now, the cookies are .
All the cookies have a sweetness .

Thus,  operations are required to increase the sweetness.
